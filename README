What's all this about eh?

I always find it difficult to name my favorite things. I can easily blurt out a 
whole bunch of bands or movies or books that I like, but ask me to list my top 5 
or 10 of all time and my eyes glaze over.

This toy helps you to figure it out by squaring the things off against each 
other one at a time. I hope you find it fun and useful.
